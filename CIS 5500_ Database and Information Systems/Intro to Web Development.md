### Web Applications are based on the Client-Server Model
* **Client**: A web browser
	* Makes requests for resources, and displays the response
	* Requests include:
		* URL - identifies the target server and what resource is being requested
		* Method type (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, etc) - specifies the intended action of the request
* **Server**: Web server (e.g. Apache HTTP Server, Node.js, NGINX)
	* Waits for client requests
	* Responds with requested resources (HTML, CSS, data, etc.)

### Full Stack Javascript
If the client and server are written in two *different* programming languages, there may be an **impedance mismatch** between the data types on the server and those on the client.
* Using JavaScript for both the server and client applications is known as *Full Stack JavaScript*.
