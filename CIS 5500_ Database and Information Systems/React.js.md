### React.js Features
* Components:
	* Stateful HTML elements that can be passed parameters
	* State can be used for conditional rendering of components
	* We will be using **functional components** rather than older **class components**.
* Unidirectional Data Flow:
	* Data is passed from parent components to children
* JSX (JavaScript XML)
	* Extended JavaScript that allows HTML to be written directly in React components
* Virtual DOM
	* A view of the HTML tree maintained by React, used to keep track of changes and only re-render components that have changed
* Events
	* Install callbacks that interact with your component upon certain user/system events
