### Definition
Suppose we have a square matrix $A_{n\times n}$/. The eigenvector $\bf{x}$ and eigenvalue $\lambda$ are related top $A$ via:
$$A\bf{x}=\lambda\bf{x}$$
Where $\bf{x}$ is a vector, which must be non-trivial (meaning it cannot be the zero-vector), and eigenvalues are scalars. $A$ can have multiple eigenvalues (up to $n$) and each eigenvalue is associated with a specific eigenvector.
