There are 2 ways to multiply two vectors:
1. **Vector Dot Product**

	Suppose two vectors, $a$ and $b$:
	$$a=[a_1,a_2,a_3]\\b=[b_1,b_2,b_3]$$
	The dot product is written as:
	$$a\cdot b$$
	This is equivalent to:
	$$(a_1b_1)+(a_2b_2)+(a_3b_3)$$
	This product is a **scalar**, a single number, NOT a vector.
	Because the dot product involves simple multiplication, it is **commutative** and **distributive**.
	Also, the dot product is equivalent to:
	$$a\cdot b=|a||b|\cos{\theta}$$
	where $\cos{\theta}$ is the angle between the two vectors $a$ and $b$, and $|a|$ and $|b|$ are the *lengths* of vectors $a$ and $b$.
	The lengths of the vectors are the **euclidean norm** pf the vector, and is computed as:
	$$|a|=\sqrt{a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2}$$
	
2. **Vector Cross Product**
	
	Suppose two vectors, $a$ and $b$:
	$$a=[1,3,4]\\b=[2,7,-5]$$
	The cross product is written as:
	$$a\times b$$
