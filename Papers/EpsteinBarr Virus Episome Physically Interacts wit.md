### EBV contacts highly active regions of the host genome
* Contacts at 10kb shared between at least 2 replicates 
	* 15,000 contacts with EBV genome, half in intronic regions, showing 1.2 fold enrichment over all genome-wise intronic regions
* Unbiased approach to determine which histone marks can distinguish EBV contacts from control regions (size-matched non-contact loci):
	* Compare mean signal intensity of histone modification in EBV contacts vs. control regions using ROC curve and its AUC.
	* H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (active chromatin markers) had highest predictive power. Also evident as mean intensity of H3K27ac in EBV contacts was higher than control loci.
		* Genomic loci w/ active histone marks were 1.2 - 2.1 fold more enriched for EBV contacts compared to control regions.
	* Conversely, histone marks associated with polycomb repression did not show strong predictive power
* Overlapping EBV contacts with typical enhancers (TEs) and super enhancers (SEs)
	* $58\%$ SE overlap and $17\%$ TE overlap in EBV contacts, compared to $22\%$ SE and $8\%$ SE in control regions.
	* Pathway analysis shows genes near to SEs with EBV contacts were enriched for B cell functions.
* EBV cintact regions had higher **ATAC-seq** signal than control regions, and ATAC sigmal had high predictive power in distinguishing EBV contacts and control regions.

### EBV contacts genomic loci bound by key host and viral transcription factors
* Top *host* transcription factors enriched at EBV contact loci fell into 3 categories: (1) TFs than regulate B cell function, (2) TFs than enhance cell proliferation, (3) TFs that affect viral replication.
* *EBV* TF-bound regions overlapped 1.5 - 2-fold more with EBV contact regions than control regions (it has been hypothesized that EBV TFs tether episome (DNA) to host chromatin), with EBNA2 and EBNA3B having highest overlap.

### 4C-seq validates EBV contacts with host active chromain regions
* Performed 4C-seq in GM12878 cells
* **oriP was used as a reference point to identiofy host chromatin in close contact with the episome**
* 4C signal in EBV bound SE loci compared to control regions
* MYC and EBV showed 10-fold increase in contact compared to control regions in contact with EBV. This was validated by a FISH-based method.
